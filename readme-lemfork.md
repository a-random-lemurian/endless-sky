# lem-fork
[< Back](/README.md)

Welcome to the lem-fork branch of the game! This branch contains the modifications Lemuria has made to Endless Sky. Some of these modifications are also in vanilla, but lem-fork receives PR changes faster than vanilla.

## Differences
- All spaceport news received by the player is logged to the console.

### Merged into vanilla
- You can override the system fence on a system-by-system basis. (https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/7704)
- You can change the date format! Choose between "Wed 4 Oct 1941", "Sat, Dec 11, 2021", and "1976-05-05". The significance of these three dates have been left as an exercise for the reader. (https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/7324)
